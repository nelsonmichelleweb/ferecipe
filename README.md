### Links

- Live Site URL: [site](https://nelsonmichelleweb.github.io/ferecipe/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to style a table, as I haven't done it before.

I got a refresher on media breakpoints, I struggled to get them to work for awhile though.

### Continued development

I would honestly like to work more on responsive design/media queries. I feel like I don't quite have a grasp on the concept.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has helped me understand almost anything, its the site I used to learn html and css.
