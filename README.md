## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Links

- Live Site URL: [site](https://nelsonmichelleweb.github.io/ferecipe/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to style a table, as I haven't done it before.

I got a refresher on media breakpoints, I struggled to get them to work for awhile though. For example, I was using max-width for the smaller size instead of min-width which is why it wouldn't work for awhile.

### Continued development

I would honestly like to work more on responsive design/media queries. I feel like I don't quite have a grasp on the concept.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has helped me understand almost anything, its the site I used to learn html and css.
